Changelog for v1.0.3

1. Block reward reduction (i.e The current block reward will be divided by 3). Emission factor is changed to 20.
2. Difficulty Target has been changed to 90 seconds. For faster block transactions.
3. Difficulty Algorithm has been changed to LWMA-V2. Thanks to Zawy. Thanks to TRTL devs for their small tweaks.
4. Timestamp attacks are now ineffective. Thanks to Jagerman.
5. Difficulty Algorithm is now more sensitive in 50x attacks. Thanks to fireice.
6. Building TEST is disabled.

About the Block reward reduction:

At the time of writing this the block reward was 496992.2409 WTIP. The block reward will be calculated using this formula (https://github.com/samvicky26/worktipscoin1/blob/dc8d17bc8356d609e503ffbfaeda2155f6ef1a3f/src/CryptoNoteCore/Currency.cpp#L179).
That will be baseReward = (Total Supply - Mined Coins)/ 2^(emission factor).
After the fork, the reward will be calculated by using 20 as emission factor && 22 as emission smoothing factor. A smoothing factor has been added to stop the drastic base reward drop.

The smoothing factor calculates the final base reward using this formula.
Final Base reward =((Total Supply - Mined Coins)/ 2^(emission factor))+((Total Supply - Mined Coins)/ 2^(emission smoothing factor)).

After doing the math, the base reward will be appx. 155299.4409651349.
